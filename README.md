## General Information
- This project involves creating a linear regression model for Booms Bike.
- The background of the project is to analyze and predict bike rental rates.
- The business problem being addressed is to improve the accuracy of rental rate predictions based on historical data.
- The dataset used includes historical bike rental data, weather conditions, and other relevant factors.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- **Temperature and Season are Significant Predictors**: The analysis shows that temperature and season are significant predictors of bike rental demand. Higher temperatures and certain seasons (e.g., summer and fall) are associated with higher rental counts.
- **Weather Conditions Impact Rentals**: Weather conditions such as humidity and wind speed also play a role in bike rental demand. Adverse weather conditions (e.g., high humidity or strong winds) tend to decrease the number of rentals.


## Technologies Used
- **Python** - version 3.x: The primary programming language used for the analysis.
- **pandas** - version 1.x: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy** - version 1.x: Used for numerical computations.
- **statsmodels** - version 0.x: Used for building and evaluating the linear regression model.
- **scikit-learn** - version 0.x: Used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **matplotlib** - version 3.x: Used for data visualization.
- **seaborn** - version 0.x: Used for statistical data visualization.
